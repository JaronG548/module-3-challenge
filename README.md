# Password Generator (M3 challenge)

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to refractor code to have a password genertaor work correctly by using JavaScript. This challenge was a bit difficult since I needed to add math and conditional statements which gives me a bit of trouble. I also had trouble figuring out where I should put some code such as should I define variables under a function locally or have it global and where should I put the Math code. I was able to figure things out with the resources I found by researching which can be found in the Credits section. The project itself should be working correctly and the user should be able to generate a random passsword. My motivation for this project was to understand JavaScript more and to see what JavaScript can be capable of. I learned more about how to write JavaScript codes correctly and I learned about Concat and hpw we can use that to put info into an empty array if that variable is called.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this resource is prety simple. I have provided the link to the deployed GitHub pages where you the user can try it out yourself. All you have to do is click the generate password button and a couple of prompts should show up and you will be able to make choices of how long you want the password to be and what characters you want.
